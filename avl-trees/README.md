# avl-trees
Trial implementation of AVL trees for DFS Lab course

Current version of the code works correctly on the extended example worked
out in Weiss (4 ed., Section 4.4) (insertion and deletion).

*IMPORTANT*: if you're looking at / using the code, please make sure that you are working with the most recent version, so that you don't run into bugs that have already been fixed.

# TODO

* Simplify code by removing parent parameter, since this information can be
  obtained from the node itself.

* Fix `print_tree().` `print_pstree()` works fine, but you need xelatex to
  compile and view the resultant pdf file that contains pictures of the
  tree.
